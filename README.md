# HOW TO PLAY WITH MODS :

2. When the Green Play button is ready
3. Clic 'Make Modded'
4. Start the game
5. When the game is loaded
6. Clic 'Make Original'
7. ENJOY !

# WHERE TO PLACE MODS :

- Modded Assets : 'Files/Modded_Assets/'
- Original Assets : 'Files/Original_Assets/'
- Pack Assets : 'Files/Pack_Assets/'

# EXEMPLE OF MODS FOLDER :

- 'Files/Modded_Assets/Assets_238/HUDIndicatorSettings.txt'		(Modified File)
- 'Files/Modded_Assets/Assets_238/XXX_Any_Other_Files' 			(Unmodified/Modified Files)
- 'Files/Original_Assets/Assets_238/HUDIndicatorSettings.txt'	(Unmodified File)
- 'Files/Original_Assets/Assets_238/XXX_Any_Other_Files' 		(Unmodified Files)
- 'Files/Pack_Assets/Assets_238.pack'							(Unmodified File)

# WHY I HAVE CRITICAL ERROR :

1. Your Assets folders aren't properly named : 'Assets_XXX' ---> Capital are sensitive, XXX is your asset number
2. Your Assets aren't found in all 3 folders (modded/original/pack)

# TERMS AND CONDITIONS :

- This tool is free and it will always be free to use.
- Modifying games files is same as hacking with external tool, such as dll injectors.
- I extremly suggest to remake assets when you see any games updates.
- You can probably get caught and be BANNED by doing this.

- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
